# üõ†Ô∏è Jarvis Data Tools Setup - Real-Time Invoice Data Access

This guide will help you configure Jarvis with **Server Tools (Webhooks)** so it can access your real-time invoice data during conversations.

## üéØ What This Enables

After setup, Jarvis will be able to:
- ‚úÖ **Get real-time portfolio summaries** ("Show me my portfolio status")
- ‚úÖ **Look up specific invoices** ("What's the status of invoice DEMO-2025-0001?")
- ‚úÖ **Filter by status** ("Show me all pending invoices")
- ‚úÖ **Find urgent items** ("What needs my immediate attention?")
- ‚úÖ **Analyze recent activity** ("What happened this week?")

## üîß Step 2: Update Agent Prompt

Update your agent's system prompt to include tool usage instructions:

```

CORE CAPABILITIES & TOOLS:
You have access to real-time invoice data through these tools:

```

## üöÄ Step 3: Test the Configuration

1. **Restart your backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd server && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the webhook endpoints** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Test portfolio summary
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis-tools/get-portfolio-summary
   
   # Test invoice lookup  
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis-tools/get-invoice-details \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"invoiceNumber": "DEMO-2025-0001"}'
   ```

3. **Activate Jarvis** and test with these questions:
   - "Jarvis, give me a portfolio summary"
   - "What's the status of invoice DEMO-2025-0001?"
   - "Show me all pending invoices"
   - "What needs my immediate attention?"
   - "What's been happening recently?"

## üé≠ Example Conversations After Setup

### Portfolio Status
```
You: "Jarvis, how are we doing?"
Jarvis: "Good day. Let me check your current portfolio... You have 5 invoices worth $26,455 total. 2 are approved with a 40% approval rate, and 1 requires attention due to exceptions. Shall I elaborate on the priority items?"
```

### Specific Invoice Lookup
```
You: "What's the status of invoice DEMO-2025-0001?"
Jarvis: "Invoice DEMO-2025-0001 from Acme Corporation for $5,000 is currently approved and ready for payment. It was received 3 days ago and processed efficiently through our validation system."
```

### Urgent Items
```
You: "What needs my attention?"
Jarvis: "Let me check your urgent items... You have 1 invoice requiring urgent attention totaling $2,500. It has validation exceptions that need review. The priority item is INV-2024-0567 from TechCorp which has been flagged for duplicate vendor verification."
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tools not working**:
- Verify webhook URLs are accessible from ElevenLabs
- Check server is running on port 3001
- Ensure no firewall blocking external requests

**Jarvis not using tools**:
- Verify tools are properly configured in agent settings
- Check system prompt includes tool usage guidelines
- Test agent in ElevenLabs dashboard first

**Connection errors**:
- For production, replace `localhost:3001` with your public server URL
- Ensure HTTPS if deploying publicly
- Check CORS settings if needed

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check server status
curl http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis/status

# Test each tool endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis-tools/get-portfolio-summary
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis-tools/get-urgent-invoices
```
