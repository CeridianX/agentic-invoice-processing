# üîß Jarvis Data Access Troubleshooting

## üö® **Issue**: Jarvis is hallucinating data instead of using real-time tools

**Symptoms**: Jarvis says highest invoice is $125,000 when it's actually $16,285.82

**Root Cause**: ElevenLabs can't reach localhost URLs or tools aren't configured correctly

---

## üéØ **Quick Diagnostic Steps**

### Step 1: Verify Your Actual Data
```bash
# Check what the real highest invoice amount is
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis-tools/get-recent-activity

# Should show: highest is $16,285.82 (DEMO-2025-0004)
```

### Step 2: Test If Jarvis Can Call Your Webhooks

**Add this test tool to your ElevenLabs agent:**

```json
{
  "name": "test_webhook_connection",
  "description": "Test if Jarvis can reach the webhook server",
  "url": "http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis-debug/test-call", 
  "method": "POST",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

**Then ask Jarvis**: *"Can you test the webhook connection?"*

**Expected result**: Jarvis should call the tool and confirm connection
**If it doesn't work**: ElevenLabs can't reach localhost

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solutions by Problem Type**

### Problem A: ElevenLabs Can't Reach Localhost

**Symptoms**: 
- Jarvis makes up data instead of calling tools
- No webhook calls visible in server logs

**Solutions**:

1. **Use ngrok (Recommended for testing)**:
   ```bash
   # Install ngrok if you haven't
   npm install -g ngrok
   
   # Expose your local server
   ngrok http 3001
   
   # Copy the https URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
   # Replace localhost:3001 with this URL in your ElevenLabs tools
   ```

2. **Deploy to a public server** (for production)

3. **Use a local tunnel service** like Cloudflare Tunnel

### Problem B: Tools Not Configured Correctly

**Symptoms**:
- Jarvis ignores data requests
- Says "I don't have access to that information"

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify tool configuration** in ElevenLabs dashboard
2. **Check system prompt** includes tool usage instructions
3. **Test individual tools** in ElevenLabs agent test interface

### Problem C: Tool Parameters Wrong

**Symptoms**:
- Tools are called but return errors
- Jarvis gets partial or incorrect data

**Solutions**:

1. **Check tool parameter definitions** match API expectations
2. **Verify JSON format** in tool configurations
3. **Test with curl** to ensure endpoints work

---

## üß™ **Complete Diagnostic Procedure**

### Step 1: Verify Server is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis/status
# Should return: {"available":true, ...}
```

### Step 2: Test Tool Endpoints Directly
```bash
# Test portfolio summary
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis-tools/get-portfolio-summary

# Should return actual data: "5 total invoices worth $26,455.64"
```

### Step 3: Add Debug Tool to ElevenLabs
Add this tool to your agent and test it:
```json
{
  "name": "debug_data_access",
  "description": "Get debug information about data access",
  "url": "http://localhost:3001/api/jarvis-debug/get-detailed-portfolio",
  "method": "POST", 
  "parameters": {}
}
```

### Step 4: Check Server Logs
When Jarvis calls tools, you should see:
```
ü§ñ [timestamp] Jarvis Tool Called: POST /api/jarvis-tools/get-portfolio-summary
üìã Headers: {...}
üì¶ Body: {...}
```

If you don't see these logs, Jarvis isn't calling the tools.

## üöÄ **Recommended Fix: Use ngrok**

**This is the fastest solution for testing:**

1. **Install and run ngrok**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3001
   ```

2. **Copy the HTTPS URL** (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

3. **Update ALL your ElevenLabs tools** to use this URL:
   - Change `http://localhost:3001` to `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
   - Example: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/jarvis-tools/get-portfolio-summary`

4. **Test again**: Ask Jarvis about the highest invoice amount

5. **Check server logs** for incoming webhook calls

---

## üé≠ **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### Before (Hallucinating):
```
You: "What's the highest invoice amount?"
Jarvis: "The highest invoice in your system is approximately $125,000..."
```

### After (Using Real Data):
```
You: "What's the highest invoice amount?" 
Jarvis: "Let me check your portfolio... The highest invoice amount is $16,285.82 for invoice DEMO-2025-0004 from Cloud Services Inc."
```

## üîç **How to Verify It's Working**

**Signs tools are working correctly**:
- ‚úÖ Server logs show webhook calls from ElevenLabs
- ‚úÖ Jarvis mentions specific invoice numbers and amounts
- ‚úÖ Data matches what you see in your actual system
- ‚úÖ Jarvis can answer follow-up questions about the data

**Signs tools are NOT working**:
- ‚ùå No webhook calls in server logs
- ‚ùå Jarvis makes up or estimates data
- ‚ùå Says "approximately" or "around" instead of exact amounts
- ‚ùå Can't provide specific invoice details

---

## üÜò **If Still Not Working**

1. **Check ElevenLabs tool configuration** - ensure URLs are correct
2. **Verify system prompt** includes tool usage instructions  
3. **Test with a simple tool first** (like the test endpoint)
4. **Check firewall/security settings** blocking webhooks
5. **Try a different tunnel service** if ngrok doesn't work

**The goal**: Jarvis should say exact amounts from your data, not estimated/hallucinated numbers!

**Once this is working, Jarvis will become incredibly powerful with real-time access to your actual invoice data.** ü§ñ‚ú®
