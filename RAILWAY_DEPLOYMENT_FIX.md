# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Fix

## ðŸš¨ **Problem Identified**
The Railway deployment is serving the **frontend React app** instead of the **backend API server**.

## ðŸ”§ **Solution: Deploy Backend Separately**

### **Option 1: Deploy Backend to Railway (Recommended)**

1. **Create a new Railway service for the backend:**
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway service create agentic-invoice-backend
   railway service link agentic-invoice-backend
   ```

2. **Deploy only the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd agentic-invoice-app/server
   railway up
   ```

3. **Set environment variables in Railway:**
   ```bash
   railway variables set DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
   railway variables set ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-elevenlabs-key"
   railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
   ```

4. **Get the backend URL:**
   ```bash
   railway domain
   ```

5. **Update frontend .env file:**
   ```bash
   VITE_API_BASE_URL="https://your-backend-url.railway.app"
   ```

### **Option 2: Use Localhost for Development**

For immediate testing, I've updated the .env to use localhost:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"
```

**To test Cara now:**
1. Start the backend server locally:
   ```bash
   cd agentic-invoice-app/server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd agentic-invoice-app/agentic-invoice-app
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Test Cara chat - it should now work with localhost backend

### **Option 3: Fix Current Railway Deployment**

The current Railway deployment should run the backend, but it's serving frontend. Check:

1. **Railway build logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Check if the start.sh script is running:**
   Look for these log entries:
   - "ðŸš€ Starting application..."
   - "ðŸŽ¯ Starting Node.js server on port..."

3. **If serving frontend instead of backend:**
   - The Dockerfile might not be working correctly
   - The start.sh script might not be executing
   - Railway might be detecting it as a frontend project

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Test**

Test the current setup with localhost:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd agentic-invoice-app/server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start frontend  
cd agentic-invoice-app/agentic-invoice-app
npm run dev

# Then test Cara chat
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**

1. **Test with localhost first** (already configured)
2. **Deploy backend properly to Railway**
3. **Update frontend .env with backend URL**
4. **Test Cara chat functionality**

## ðŸ”„ **Expected Result**

Once the backend is properly deployed and the .env is updated:
- Cara chat will open and stay open
- Tool calls will succeed
- Cara will provide invoice portfolio information
- Chat conversation will be maintained
